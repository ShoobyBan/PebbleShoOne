ShoOne Watchface for Pebble
===========================

This is a highly readable analog watchface for the [Pebble Smartwatch][pebble], intended for every-day use.

This version is built on the [Pebble SDK 3.0][sdk3], the project is a simplified version of the incredibly good-looking [pebbleone][PebbleONE] watchface.
